    "### Metacritic Reviews\n",
    "\n",
    "The Metacritic dataset originates from https://www.kaggle.com/skateddu/metacritic-critic-games-reviews-20112019 and was created by Andrea Cadeddu. It contains over 120,000 _individual reviews_ for many videogames, as well as the score each review gives each game. It will be used for text classification, particularly sentiment analysis of these reviews. I intend it as a more relevant-to-me alternative to the IMDB dataset as a sort of hello-world for sentiment analysis. Metacritic was chosen because it is a _meta_-review site; it compiles reviews published by other game journalism outlets."
